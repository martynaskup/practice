# practice

<h3>Project created in order to practice React (with/without Hooks and different tech-stack) and build some templates/boilerplates</h3>

<p>I will be continuosly updating this project with new functions/features and new projects when new ideas show up or when I want to practice something already done.</p>
<p>The main point of this project is to practice what I know and try out new things - all related to React and JavaScript ES6+ (and a few other tech-stack like for example different APIs, Firebase, Local Storage).</p>

<p>I encourage you to take a look at the different projects included in this practice-repository. Maybe you will get inspired. ;) </p>

<p><b>The styling will be mostly basic as the main point of this project is the functionality.</b></p>
